# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose: This analysis is intended to summarize data of the ride-sharing app by city type to better inform decision-making at PyBer. The summary consists of three key deliverables:

  *A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type included in the data
  *A miltiple-line chart of total fares for each city type included in the data
  *This written report summarizing the PyBer analysis from which questions and clarifications may be made.
  
## Results

  Key differences in ride-sharing data among various city types were identified in this analysis. This data include: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. See below for notable outcomes
  
  *Total fare by city type is nearly double for urban rides when compared to suburban rides, and higher than rural rides by at least 10 orders of magnitude
  *Total fare among all city types spiked in the last quarter of February.
  *Differences between total fare between city types remained stable throughout the 4-month investigative period.
  
## Conclusions

  *Disparities among city types will continue to favor riders in urban areas who enjoy a lower average fare per rider. We suggest increasing the fare for urban rides.
  *The average fare per driver overwhelmingly favors rural drivers and are disproportionatly higher than the relative difference in fares for riders of Urban, Suburbanm and Rural rides. Consider reducing the fares paid to rural drivers.
  *Lastly, there is an overwhelming number of urban drivers relative to suburban and rural drivers relative to rides taken. Perhaps incentives to drivers of rural and suburban communities could be identified to inspire greater riding opportunities.
